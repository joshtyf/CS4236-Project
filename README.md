# NUS [CS4236](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS4236/cryptography-theory-and-practice) Project

I took CS4236 back in AY21/22 S1 under Prof Hugh. As part of the course assignments, my team and I were tasked to write a simple paper on security formulations for NFTs. 

You can find our paper [here](CS4236%20Grp%209%20Paper.pdf). It can also be found on page 101 of our [course proceedings](CS4236_2021_Projects.pdf).
The slides that we used for our final presentation for this course is also present in this respository.
